### Tests

_How do you run tests?_

I ran tests for each band member class (`Guitarist`, `Bassist`, `Drummer`), then each `Musician`, and then each `Band` class. 

_Any tests of note?_

In my main loop, I called each instance of the `__str__` & `__rpr__` wrappers, as well as the methods & attributes of the class buildout. 

_Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc_

I have not yet completed the stretch goals.
